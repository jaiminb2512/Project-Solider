Project Name :- Style Heaven

I made Style Heaven, an interactive and dynamic fashion store website. Through this project, I implemented and enhanced my JavaScript skills.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:

1. As the user hovers over a cap, shirt, pant, or shoes, that image takes up the entire size of the container.
2. As the user clicks on any one of them, they are redirected to the shopping page, which contains a card for that item. All the cards are generated dynamically using JavaScript.
3. The user can also reach the shopping page by using the header.

ðŸŒŸ What I Learned:

1. Implementation of JavaScript in websites.
2. Understanding loops in JavaScript.
3. Dynamically fetching images from a folder.
4. Understanding the use and importance of JavaScript arrays.


To run this project just clone it and make img folder. 
Then put images.
